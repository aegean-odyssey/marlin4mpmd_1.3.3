This binary contains the stock bootloader for the Monoprice Mini Delta Printer.
This is only necessary to in case you are to overwrite the original bootloader by updating the firmware using a ST-LINK debugger.  This may also be necessary if you have disabled the security bits on the microcontroller using a debugger.  Flash this binary to 0x0000 - 0x1FFF to restore the original bootloader.  The bootloader is entirely optional if you are debugging directly on the target hardware, by commenting out the STM32_USE_BOOTLOADER line in main.h, the Marlin4MPMD code will be linked at address 0x0000.  Otherwise, it will reside at 0x2000 and expected to be loaded by the bootloader.
